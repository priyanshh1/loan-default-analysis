# Predicting Loan Default with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict loan default using machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost. By analyzing borrower data, the model helps financial institutions assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

## Dataset

- Sourced from Kaggle or similar financial datasets.
- Features include loan amount, interest rate, employment length, income, and default status.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib

## Key Steps

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance comparison

## Results

- Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy and AUC scores.
- XGBoost slightly outperformed Random Forest in identifying defaults.
